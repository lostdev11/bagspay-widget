# Logo Files

Place your logo file here with one of the following names:
- `logo.png` (preferred)
- `logo.svg`
- `logo.jpg` or `logo.jpeg`
- `logo.webp`

The logo component will automatically try these formats in order. If no logo file is found, it will fall back to the default SVG icon.

- **Format**: PNG or SVG (transparent background recommended)
- **Size**: At least 512x512 pixels for best quality
